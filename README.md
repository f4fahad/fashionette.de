First of all, thank you very much for giving me this opportunity.
I try to put this into the framework.

1. You should have latest python, selenium, pytest, pytest-html version installed.
2. You only need to run the run.bat file.
3. After executing the test cases, reports will be generated into the report folder.
4. After executing the test cases, logs will be generated in the logs folder.
5. If any test case become failed, screenshot will be saved in the Screenshots folder.

Note: If any test case become failed, try to rerun the run.bat file.

Thank you.
